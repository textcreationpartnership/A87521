            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It was a cuſtome amongſt the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> firſt to learne to he ſilent, and after that Leſſon was perfect, then they learn'd to ſpeake: But a generation of <hi>Tautologicall Tongue-men,</hi> have not yet learned how or when to ſpeake, or hold their peace; theſe grave ungrammar'd <hi>Thebans,</hi> and moſt learned illiterate <hi>Athenians,</hi> (with much pumping for wit, and belabouring the cuſhion) have brought too much gall to the Pulpit, and ſuch ſtore of worme-wood to the Preſſe, that hath drench'd too many of us in the gall of bitterneſſe, and enſnar'd us too faſt in the bond of iniquitie.

            <p>What a glorious ſhew of Allegeance and Loyaltie did too many of his Majeſties falſe ſervants make; but all thoſe faire ſhewes were no better then falſe ſhadowes: the Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their faithfull dutie, was like an Obligation ſeal'd with &amp;c. they were only tinſel'd over with Oathes, Vowes, flattering Cringes, and diſſembling words &amp; geſtures: and yet this kind of ſcurvie counterfeit Stuffe did make an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable ſhamefull gliſtring ſhew at the Court; but that was not Gold that gliſtred.</p>
            <p>Our Blew-bonnetted bonny Brethren did ſweare by their Soules, that they waud leeve &amp; dey for the guds of the King and Kingdomes: Thoſe Golden Promiſes did gliſter to us; for which, our Golden Treaſure ſhined on them abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, fooliſhly, knaviſhly. We had ungodly falſe Knaves, and cut-throat Plundring Theeves and Villaines of our owne, but our owne would not ſerve our turnes; we were ſo prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall to waſte our Money, to buy and hire thouſands of Tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdemalian, mad Raggamuffin, terrible Tarmagant <hi>Scots:</hi> but now our after-wit tels us, that we have as ſufficient and able Raſcals of our own <hi>Engliſh</hi> breeding, as either <hi>Scotland</hi> or Hell it ſelfe could afford us; ſo that our Money which we layd out, was meerly caſt away: for if we conſider what they did to deſerve it, we ſhal find, that they did us but little good, and much miſchiefe; all which we could have done our ſelves, &amp; ſo have ſaved our gliſtring Gold in our purſes. But though we did buy many <hi>Scots,</hi> yet we did not buy their Religion &amp; <hi>Kirk</hi> Diſcipline: for if we could have bin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> we would never have bin ſo mad as to have purchas'd a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Church-Government; nor had they any reaſon, or manners, to preſume audaciouſly to
